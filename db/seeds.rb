# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


# User.destroy_all
#
# User.create!(
#   username: 'user',
#   password: 'password',
#   first_name: 'John',
#   last_name: 'Smith',
#   bio: 'This is my bio.',
#   rant_rate: 'weekly'
